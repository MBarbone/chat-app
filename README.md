# chat-app

This app was built using socket.io to manage real time bi-lateral communication for users chatting. Simply enter your display name and the name of the group chat you would like to start. Other users simply need to do the same, entering the same chat name, to enter the group. The app will notify users when others join or leave the group and you can even send your current location. Demo the app here: https://barbone-chat-app.herokuapp.com/
